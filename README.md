Hej, this is Bob Olsen, chemistry instructor (general and physical chemistry) and coding enthusiast (I can still speak Fortran77 but primarily use Python these days) at Stockton University.  I'm especially interested in nonlinear chemical dynamics, small molecule electronic structure calculations, and data visualization.  &#x1F6B4; for work/life balance (as I learned from a jersey in an Amherst, MA bike shop, circa 1995:  live to ride ... ride to work ... work to eat ... eat to live).
